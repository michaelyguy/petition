                          <p>on May 29, Derek Chauvin was arrested and charged with second 
                          degree murder, third degree murder and manslaughter. The other 
                          three officers were charged with aiding and abetting second degree murder, 
                          aiding and abetting third degree murder and aiding and abetting manslaughter. 
                          But the fight for justice continues, as does the need to keep a spotlight on 
                          Minneapolis. Please help me make sure there is a fair judicial process that 
                          results in justice and in the conviction of George Floyd's murderers.
                          </p>
